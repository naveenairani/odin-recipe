        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Pizza is an oven-baked flat bread typically topped with a tomato sauce, cheese and various toppings. The modern pizza was invented in Naples, Italy, and the dish has since become popular in many parts of the world. An establishment that makes and sells pizzas is called a "pizzeria".</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>Warm Water</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Capsicum</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <h3>Step 1:Prepare the Dough</h3>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine 2 1/4 teaspoons of dry yeast with 1 cup of warm water. Let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
            Add 2 1/2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture and knead until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</p>
        <h3>Step 2:Roll out the Dough</h3>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
            Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness, shaping it into a round or rectangular pizza crust.</p>
        <h3>Step 3:Assemble the Pizza</h3>
        <p>Spread a thin layer of ketchup over the rolled-out dough as the base sauce.
            Sprinkle a generous amount of grated cheese evenly over the sauce.
            Add sliced onions, tomatoes, and capsicum on top of the cheese.</p>
        <h3>Step 4:Bake the Pizza</h3>
        <p>Place the assembled pizza on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>
        <h3>Step 5:Check for Doneness</h3>
        <p>Keep an eye on the pizza to ensure it doesn't burn. The edges should be golden brown, and the cheese should be fully melted.</p>
        <h3>Step 6:Serve and enjoy</h3>
        <p>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.
            Serve your delicious homemade pizza slices and enjoy!</p>
